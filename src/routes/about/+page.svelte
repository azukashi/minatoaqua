					Personality
				</h1>
				<p class="text-base my-3 text-right">
					Aqua is a bumbling airhead who somehow manages to become the victim of every joke in which she gets
					involved. She is also child-ish and prone to throwing tantrums, smashing her keyboard, and
					hyperventilating when things don't go as planned (which is most of the time). She enjoys playing
					pranks and causing mischief, but it almost always backfires because of a combination of poor
					planning and bad luck.
					<br />
					<br />
					According to other Hololive members, Aqua is kind and responsible but extremely introverted while off-camera,
					only opening up while streaming.
